Description: It is often advantageous to test a hypothesis more than once in the context of propensity
    score analysis (Rosenbaum, 2012). The functions in this package facilitate bootstrapping for
    propensity score analysis. By default, bootstrapping using two classificaiton tree methods
    (using rpart and ctree functions), two matching methods (using Matching and MatchIt packages),
    and stratification with logistic regression are used. Framework is provided for users to
    implement additional methods. Visualizations are emphasized for diagnosing balance; exploring
    the correlation relationships between bootstrap samples and methods; and to summarize results.
