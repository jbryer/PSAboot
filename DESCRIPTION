Description: It is often advantageous to test a hypothesis more than once
    in the context of propensity score analysis (Rosenbaum, 2012)
    <doi:10.1093/biomet/ass032>. The functions in this package facilitate
    bootstrapping for propensity score analysis. By default, bootstrapping
    using two classification tree methods (using 'rpart' and 'ctree'
    functions), two matching methods (using 'Matching' and 'MatchIt'
    packages), and stratification with logistic regression are used.
    A framework is described for users to implement additional methods.
    Visualizations are emphasized for diagnosing balance; exploring the
    correlation relationships between bootstrap samples and methods; and
    to summarize results.
