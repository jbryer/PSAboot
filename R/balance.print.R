#' Print method for balance.
#' 
#' This is a crude measure of overall balance. Absolute value of the standardized
#' effect sizes are calculated for each covariate. Overall balance statistics are
#' the mean of those effect sizes after adjustment for each method across all
#' bootstrap samples.
#' 
#' @param x results from \code{\link{balance}}.
#' @param na.rm whether NA balance statistics should be removed before averaging them.
#' @param ... currently unused.
#' @method print PSAboot.balance
#' @export
